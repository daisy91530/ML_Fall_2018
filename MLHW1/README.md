There are two datasets need to be analyzed. For each dataset, you have to do the following:

Visualize the basic statistics like average, standard deviation and value

counts of every feature.

Preprocess the data, so that it can be used as training data & testing

data.

Use the data to generate a decision tree model with any package you

want.

Generate decision tree models to construct a random forest model. Please

note that package-provided random forest model is NOT allowed in this

step.

Use confusion matrix, resubstitution validation (i.e. identical training and

testing set) and K-fold cross validation with K > 1 to validate the performance of your models.
